Facade design pattern:

The Facade design pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system, making it easier for clients to interact with the system. It encapsulates the complex interactions and operations of multiple classes into a single interface.

Let's create an example of a Facade pattern for a computer system, where we have multiple subsystems such as CPU, Memory, and Hard Drive. The Facade, ComputerFacade, will provide a simple interface to start and stop the computer, hiding the complexity of the subsystem interactions.

    def shutdown(self):
        print("Computer shutting down.")
        # Some shutdown operations here...

# Client code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    computer = ComputerFacade()
    computer.start()    # Output: CPU: Freezing... Memory: Loading data 'boot_data' to address 0 CPU: Jumping to position 16 CPU: Executing instructions... Computer started.
    computer.shutdown() # Output: Computer shutting down.






"""
In this example, we have the complex subsystem classes CPU, Memory, and HardDrive, each with its specific operations. The ComputerFacade acts as a simplified interface to the computer system.

The ComputerFacade encapsulates the interactions and operations of the subsystems required to start and shut down the computer. The start() method initializes the computer by performing the necessary operations in the correct sequence. The shutdown() method handles the steps for shutting down the computer.

The client code only interacts with the ComputerFacade, making it easier to start and stop the computer without worrying about the details of the individual subsystems.

By using the Facade pattern, we hide the complexity of the subsystems from the client, providing a more straightforward and user-friendly interface for interacting with the computer system. This makes the code easier to maintain and understand, as the client code doesn't need to be aware of the internal workings of the complex subsystems.
